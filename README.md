# CTF_Scan
This tool can do a complete scan of almost any CTF in my experience.
This script is intended to run inside kali linux although it can be used in any OS.

# Installation and usage
```console
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/M4luk0/CTF_Scan.git

# change the working directory
$ cd CTF_Scan

# install the requirements

# execute the script and follow the instructions
$ bash CTF_Scan.sh
```
